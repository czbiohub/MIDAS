The MIDAS-IGGdb tool under construction in this repo is based on the
original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS) with modifications
that integrate all 23,790 species from [IGGdb](https://github.com/snayfach/IGGdb).
The original MIDAS db version 1.2 spanned only 5,926 species.

To support the larger database, the original MIDAS `run_species` command
is being deprecated in favor of the new [IGGSearch tool](https://github.com/snayfach/IGGsearch).
Details on how this affects various workflows will follow shortly.

A verbatim copy of [the original documentation](old-docs/README.md) is still
maintained in this repo while it is under construction.
